# ICAA Film Data Scraper

This project is a web scraping tool designed to extract film data from the ICAA (Instituto de la Cinematograf√≠a y de las Artes Audiovisuales) website. The tool is implemented using Python and utilizes libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and `selenium` to automate the data extraction process. The extracted data is saved into Excel files for further analysis.

## Features

- Scrapes film data for a specified range of years.
- Handles pagination and dynamic content loading using Selenium.
- Utilizes multiple User-Agent strings to avoid detection and blocking.
- Includes robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Saves the extracted data into well-structured Excel files.
